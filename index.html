    <h2>Welcome to Puppyz, a Puppy Adoption Center!</h2>
    <h3>Why adopt a puppy from Puppyz?</h3>
    <p>
      Pups Adoption Service gives you the opportunity to adopt a very cute and
      playful puppy. Our puppies are looking for a family and a home. We make
      sure to vaccinate and housetrain them before you can take them home. You
      won't have to potty-train them, yay! Also, we are more affordable than if
      you were to buy a puppy vs adopt. More savings for you! What are you
      waiting for? Go find your puppy on our
      <a href="puppies.html">Puppies</a> page.
